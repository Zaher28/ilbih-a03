     When getting into a fitness program, you may want to figure out your target heart rate

     Create a program that prompts for your age and your resting heart rate. Use the Karvonen
     formula to determine the target heart rate based on a range of intensities from 55% to 95%.
     Generate a table with the results as shown in the example output.
